                "abstract": "Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) reflects the ability of blood vessels to dilate and constrict in response to a vasoactive stimulus and is an important indicator of cerebrovascular health. CVR can be mapped non-invasively with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in combination with a breath-hold (BH) task. There are several ways to analyse this type of data and retrieve individual CVR amplitude and timing information. The most common approach involves employing a time-shifted general linear model with the measured end-tidal carbon dioxide signal as a regressor of interest. In this work, we introduce a novel method for CVR mapping based on a variational Bayesian approach. We analysed BOLD fMRI data from six participants that performed a BH task in ten different sessions each, and computed the corresponding CVR amplitude and delay maps for each session/subject. No statistically significant differences were observed between the modelling approaches in the CVR delay and amplitude maps in grey matter. Notably, the largest difference between methods was apparent in the case of low CVR amplitude, attributed to how each method addressed noisy voxels, particularly in white matter and cerebral spinal fluid. Both approaches showed highly reproducible CVR amplitude maps where between-subject variability was significantly larger than between-session variability. Furthermore, our results illustrated that the Bayesian approach is more computationally efficient, and future implementations could incorporate more complex noise models, non-linear fitting, and \u2026"

Here we propose a novel approach that addresses all these limitations. Specifically, we introduce MvME-SPFM (multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping), a novel hemodynamic deconvolution algorithm that operates at the whole brain level and adds spatial information via a mixed-norm regularization term over all voxels. Additionally, MvME-SPFM employs a stability selection procedure that removes the need to select regularization parameters and also lets us obtain an estimate of the true probability of having a neuronal-related BOLD event at each voxel and time-point based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths. Besides, the formulation is tailored for multi-echo fMRI acquisitions, which allows us to better isolate fluctuations of BOLD origin on the basis of their \u2026"

Moreover, while physiological factors such as blood pressure show a significant relationship with CVR, they do not with common RSF metrics.

                "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular method for in vivo neuroimaging. Modern fMRI sequences are often weighted towards the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is closely linked to neuronal activity (Logothetis, 2002). This weighting is achieved by tuning several parameters to increase the BOLD-weighted signal contrast. One such parameter is \u201cTE,\u201d or echo time. TE is the amount of time elapsed between when protons are excited (the MRI signal source) and measured. Although the total measured signal magnitude decays with echo time, BOLD sensitivity increases (Silvennoinen et al., 2003). The optimal TE maximizes the BOLD signal weighting based on a number of factors, including several MRI scanner parameters (eg, field strength), imaged tissue composition (eg, grey vs. white matter), and proximity to air-tissue boundaries.Even as optimal TE values vary by brain region, most whole-brain fMRI scans are \u201csingleecho,\u201d where signal is collected at a fixed TE everywhere in the brain. This TE value is often based on either a value that is best on average across all brain regions or an optimised value for a specific region of interest (Peters et al., 2007; St\u00f6cker et al., 2006). Generally, these choices reflect a tradeoff between BOLD weighting, overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal loss due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts. Further, for any TE with BOLD signal there is also susceptibility to contamination from noise sources including head motion, respiration, and cardiac pulsation (Caballero-Gaudes & Reynolds, 2017; Chang & Glover, 2009; Murphy et al., 2013; Power et al., 2018)."

Albeit conventional deconvolution algorithms have been around for a long time (e.g., Wiener deconvolution), recent state-of-the-art methods based on sparsity-pursuing regularization are attracting increasing interest to investigate brain dynamics and connectivity with fMRI. This technical note revisits the main concepts underlying two main methods, Paradigm Free Mapping and Total Activation, in the most accessible way. Despite their apparent differences in the formulation, these methods are theoretically equivalent as they represent the synthesis and analysis sides of the same problem, respectively. We demonstrate this equivalence in practice with their best-available implementations using both simulations, with different signal-to-noise ratios, and experimental fMRI data acquired during a motor task and resting-state. We evaluate the parameter settings that lead to equivalent results, and showcase the potential of these algorithms compared to other common approaches. This note is useful for practitioners interested in gaining a better understanding of state-of-the-art hemodynamic deconvolution, and aims to answer questions that practitioners often have regarding the differences between the two methods."

Here, we propose a novel mathematical framework that jointly estimates resting-state functional networks and spatially more localised cross-regional modulations. To do so, the changes in activity of each brain region are modelled by a logistic regression including co-activation coefficients (reflective of network assignment, as they highlight simultaneous activations across areas) and causal interplays \u2026"

Based on previous work on the field, a new signal model is proposed in order to take the processing from a voxelwise analysis to an entire brain one. Different proximal operators have been studied for solving the optimisation problem present in the deconvolution, since it is an ill-posed inverse problem, and a novel method based on the stability selection procedure has been suggested to answer to the choice of the regularization parameter dilemma. The method takes advantage of the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths to avoid the selection of a single regularization parameter. An optimal approach for the thresholding of AUC timeseries is studied and different debiasing methods for removing the sparsity in prolonged events are presented. The results demonstrate that the MvMESPFM algorithm provides promising results when estimating neuronal-related events even on noisy data. Subject to being thoroughly tested on experimental data, testing conducted on simulated signals suggests that the tool could eventually be introduced to the processing pipelines of different research lines regarding fMRI data analysis."

Our results demonstrate that this method is efficient to remove undesired signal contributions and improve the spatial specificity of brain activation maps."

This work sheds light on our understanding of two state-of-the-art approaches based on L1-norm regularized estimators: Paradigm Free Mapping (synthesis model) and Total Activation (analysis model). Through simulations with varying signal-to-noise ratios, and an experimental motor task dataset, we demonstrate that both formulations produce identical estimates of the innovation and activity-inducing signals underlying BOLD events when identical hemodynamic response and regularization parameters are used. These observations open up the possibility for future developments without questioning their core formulation and performance."

By leveraging a high-quality precision functional mapping dataset of breath-hold induced cerebrovascular reactivity (7 subjects with 10 sessions each), we assessed how much parcellations describing different architectures (ie vascular anatomy, functional networks, subcortical anatomy) could present internal homogeneity, and hence explain these regionally-specific reliability. We found that all architectures taken into account can equally explain these spatial patterns of cerebrovascular reactivity."

During a BOLD fMRI acquisition, breath-holding is a simple approach for increasing blood CO 2 levels, thereby driving the vasodilatory CVR response. However, breath-holding is associated with increased head motion artifacts, which can confound our estimates of CVR. We demonstrate that multi-echo BOLD fMRI acquisitions, in conjunction with denoising with multi-echo independent component analysis approaches, enable better differentiation of true vasodilatory responses and improve the reliability of CVR estimates across multiple sessions in highly sampled individuals."

Here, we probed the level of complexity at which motion should be characterised. To do so, we designed a clustering-based approach that determines the spatio-temporal motion patterns that can fingerprint an individual. We found that each subject's motion could be fingerprinted at a different space/time granularity, some more easily than others. Our results call for refined motion descriptions in which space and time should not be over-simplified, and point towards the relevance of motion-related fingerprints as an individual's functional trait."
