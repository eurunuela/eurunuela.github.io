The goal of this thesis is to enhance and expand techniques for identifying and analyzing individual trial event-related BOLD responses based on the Paradigm Free Mapping (PFM) algorithm, which utilizes a linear hemodynamic response model and relies on regularized least squares estimators to deconvolve the neuronal-related signal that drives the BOLD effect. Notably, these techniques estimate neuronal-related activity without relying on prior paradigm information."

Whereas practitioners are usually familiar with gradient-based algorithms, commonly used to solve unconstrained, smooth optimization problems, proximal algorithms can be viewed as analogous tools for non-smooth and possibly constrained versions of such problems. These algorithms sit at a higher level of abstraction than gradient-based algorithms and require a basic operation to be performed at each iteration: the evaluation of the so-called proximal operator of the functional to be optimized. PyProximal is a Python-based library aimed at democratizing the application of convex optimization to scientific problems; it provides the required building blocks (ie, proximal operators and algorithms) to define and solve complex, convex objective functions in a high-level, abstract fashion, shielding users away from any unneeded mathematical and implementation details."

                "abstract": "Neuroimaging plays a significant role in understanding the neurophysiology of Tourette syndrome (TS), in particular the main symptom, tics, and the urges associated with them. Premonitory urge is thought to be a negative reinforcer of tic expression in TS. Tic expression during neuroimaging is most often required as an overt marker of increased urge-to-tic, which can lead to considerable head movement, and thus data loss. This study aims to identify the brain regions involved in urge in healthy subjects using multi-echo functional MRI and a timing-free approach to localise the BOLD response associated with the urge-to-act without information of when these events occur. Blink suppression is an analogous behaviour that can be expressed overtly in the MRI scanner which gives rise to an urge like those described by individuals with TS. We examined the urge-to-blink in 20 healthy volunteers with an experimental paradigm including two conditions, \"Okay to blink\" and \"Suppress blinking\", to identify brain regions involved in blink suppression. Multi-echo functional MRI data was analysed using a novel approach to investigate the BOLD signal correlated with the build-up of the urge-to-blink that participants continuously reported using a rollerball device. In addition, we used the method of multi-echo paradigm free mapping (MESPFM) to identify these regions without prior specification of task timings. Subjective urge scores were correlated with activity in the right posterior and ventral-anterior insula as well as the mid-cingulate and occipital cortices. Furthermore, blink suppression was associated with activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \u2026"

                "abstract": "Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR), the brain's vascular response to a vasodilatory stimulus, can be measured using fMRI during breathing challenges that modulate arterial CO2 levels. CVR is an important indicator of cerebrovascular health, although its estimation can be challenging due to the extra experimental setup and/or the subject compliance required. To overcome these limitations, summary metrics  based on resting state fluctuations (RSF), such as the (fractional) amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (f/ALFF) and the resting state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), have been proposed as alternative estimates of CVR, as they are frequently associated with vascular and physiological factors. Previous studies have reported a significant relationship between CVR estimates obtained by means of respiratory paradigms and RSF metrics. However, the total sample sizes, considering both subjects and sessions, are typically small, and not all studies agree on the degree of the relationship. Furthermore, to our knowledge, these studies have only reported cross-sectional analyses, whereas intra-subject longitudinal relationships between CVR estimates and RSF metrics are unknown. Leveraging a unique dense sampling dataset in which resting state and breath-hold multi-echo fMRI were collected in 7 subjects with 10 sessions each, we provide evidence of high individual variability in the inter-session (i.e. intra-subject) relationship between RSF metrics and CVR. These results indicate that RSF metrics might not be a suitable proxy of CVR in clinical settings or for BOLD signal calibration as they may not properly account for intra-individual \u2026"

CVR can be mapped non-invasively with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in combination with a breath-hold (BH) task. There are several ways to analyse this type of data and retrieve individual CVR amplitude and timing information. The most common approach involves employing a time-shifted general linear model with the measured end-tidal carbon dioxide signal as a regressor of interest. In this work, we introduce a novel method for CVR mapping based on a variational Bayesian approach. We analysed BOLD fMRI data from six participants that performed a BH task in ten different sessions each, and computed the corresponding CVR amplitude and delay maps for each session/subject. No statistically significant differences were observed between the modelling approaches in the CVR delay and amplitude maps in grey matter. Notably, the largest difference between methods was apparent in the case of low CVR amplitude, attributed to how each method addressed noisy voxels, particularly in white matter and cerebral spinal fluid. Both approaches showed highly reproducible CVR amplitude maps where between-subject variability was significantly larger than between-session variability. Furthermore, our results illustrated that the Bayesian approach is more computationally efficient, and future implementations could incorporate more complex noise models, non-linear fitting, and \u2026"

Albeit conventional deconvolution algorithms have been around for a long time (e.g., Wiener deconvolution), recent state-of-the-art methods based on sparsity-pursuing regularization are attracting increasing interest to investigate brain dynamics and connectivity with fMRI. This technical note revisits the main concepts underlying two main methods, Paradigm Free Mapping and Total Activation, in the most accessible way. Despite their apparent differences in the formulation, these methods are theoretically equivalent as they represent the synthesis and analysis sides of the same problem, respectively. We demonstrate this equivalence in practice with their best-available implementations using both simulations, with different signal-to-noise ratios, and experimental fMRI data acquired during a motor task and resting-state. We evaluate the parameter settings that lead to equivalent results, and showcase the potential of these algorithms compared to other common approaches. This note is useful for practitioners interested in gaining a better understanding of state-of-the-art hemodynamic deconvolution, and aims to answer questions that practitioners often have regarding the differences between the two methods."

Additionally, MvME-SPFM employs a stability selection procedure that removes the need to select regularization parameters and also lets us obtain an estimate of the true probability of having a neuronal-related BOLD event at each voxel and time-point based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths.

Using a densely sampled fMRI dataset, we demonstrate high individual variability in the inter-session relationships between RSF metrics and CVR. Moreover, while physiological factors such as blood pressure show a significant relationship with CVR, they do not with common RSF metrics. These results indicate that RSF parameters might not be suitable alternatives for CVR, and may not properly account for inter-individual physiological variations in BOLD fMRI data."

                "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular method for in vivo neuroimaging. Modern fMRI sequences are often weighted towards the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is closely linked to neuronal activity (Logothetis, 2002). This weighting is achieved by tuning several parameters to increase the BOLD-weighted signal contrast. One such parameter is \u201cTE,\u201d or echo time. TE is the amount of time elapsed between when protons are excited (the MRI signal source) and measured. Although the total measured signal magnitude decays with echo time, BOLD sensitivity increases (Silvennoinen et al., 2003). The optimal TE maximizes the BOLD signal weighting based on a number of factors, including several MRI scanner parameters (eg, field strength), imaged tissue composition (eg, grey vs. white matter), and proximity to air-tissue boundaries.Even as optimal TE values vary by brain region, most whole-brain fMRI scans are \u201csingleecho,\u201d where signal is collected at a fixed TE everywhere in the brain. This TE value is often based on either a value that is best on average across all brain regions or an optimised value for a specific region of interest (Peters et al., 2007; St\u00f6cker et al., 2006). Generally, these choices reflect a tradeoff between BOLD weighting, overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal loss due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts. Further, for any TE with BOLD signal there is also susceptibility to contamination from noise sources including head motion, respiration, and cardiac pulsation (Caballero-Gaudes & Reynolds, 2017; Chang & Glover, 2009; Murphy et al., 2013; Power et al., 2018)."

In this study, we evaluate the performance of multiple analysis strategies based on lagged general linear models applied on multi-echo BOLD fMRI data, acquired in ten subjects performing a BH task during ten sessions, to obtain subject-specific CVR and haemodynamic lag estimates.

If large-scale functional networks or states are studied, more local regional rearrangements are then not described, potentially missing important neurobiological information. Here, we propose a novel mathematical framework that jointly estimates resting-state functional networks and spatially more localised cross-regional modulations. To do so, the changes in activity of each brain region are modelled by a logistic regression including co-activation coefficients (reflective of network assignment, as they highlight simultaneous activations across areas) and causal interplays \u2026"

Based on previous work on the field, a new signal model is proposed in order to take the processing from a voxelwise analysis to an entire brain one. Different proximal operators have been studied for solving the optimisation problem present in the deconvolution, since it is an ill-posed inverse problem, and a novel method based on the stability selection procedure has been suggested to answer to the choice of the regularization parameter dilemma. The method takes advantage of the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths to avoid the selection of a single regularization parameter. An optimal approach for the thresholding of AUC timeseries is studied and different debiasing methods for removing the sparsity in prolonged events are presented. The results demonstrate that the MvMESPFM algorithm provides promising results when estimating neuronal-related events even on noisy data. Subject to being thoroughly tested on experimental data, testing conducted on simulated signals suggests that the tool could eventually be introduced to the processing pipelines of different research lines regarding fMRI data analysis."
