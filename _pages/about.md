# About me

Hello! Iâ€™m Eneko UruÃ±uela, a biomedical engineer with a PhD focused on machine learning for brain imaging. Iâ€™m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Calgary, Canada](https://ucalgary.ca/labs/miplab/home), where I develop deep learning models aimed at predicting tissue outcomes in stroke patients.

<span class="text-color-highlight">I am passionate about making healthcare more accessible and believe that technology can play a crucial role in achieving this goal.</span> Beyond my research, Iâ€™m deeply interested in personal knowledge management and note-taking strategies that enhance productivity and personal growth.

In my free time, I enjoy running, savoring coffee, and capturing the world through photography. Iâ€™m also an avid reader and a music enthusiast, always on the lookout for new books and playlists to inspire me.

Let's connect! ðŸ‘‡
