# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/) and [Hotchkiss Brain Institute](https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/), working with Dr. Nils Forkert on developing AI models that predict tissue outcome in stroke patients.

Previously, I worked at [BCBL](https://bcbl.eu) with Dr. CÃ©sar Caballero-Gaudes, where I focused on developing methods to analyze fMRI data, particularly the Paradigm Free Mapping method. You can read my PhD thesis <a href="https://phd.enekourunuela.com" target="_blank">on this interactive website</a>.

I am a strong advocate for open science and open source software development. A significant portion of my time is dedicated to developing and maintaining open-source tools for the neuroimaging community, such as:

- [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana): An open-source Python library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data
- [Rica](https://github.com/eurunuela/rica): A Python tool to classify ICA components from multi-echo fMRI data
- [Phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids): A Python tool to format physiological recordings to BIDS format

You can find more about my work and contributions in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/eurunuela).
